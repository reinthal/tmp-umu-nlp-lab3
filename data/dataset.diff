< ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
< there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
< so basically tasted watered down .
< she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
< i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
< just left and took it off the bill .
< it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
< definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
< new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
< but it probably sucks too !
< we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
< the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
< there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
< said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
< the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
< there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
< the wine was very average and the food was even less .
< staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
< the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
< blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
< my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .
< she said `` yes , sorry . ''
< the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .
< there was only meat and bread .
< when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
< she was not happy being there .
< moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .
< the associates program is no longer an option .
< the decor was seriously lacking .
< anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
< the sales people here are terrible .
< salsa is not hot or good .
< so i asked for the card to be refunded .
< i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
< i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
< all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .
< the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .
< they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
< we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .
< always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
< they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
< i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
< my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
< when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
< you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
< i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
< i was very sick the night after .
< i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .
< i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
< had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
< the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .
< this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
< then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
< do not go to this practice they are horrible !
< i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
< the only saving grace was the black beans .
< lost a long time customer !
< other than that , food here is pretty gross .
< i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
< so far i 'm not really impressed .
< my groupon is only for the two windows .
< safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .
< the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
< we will not be using this location again .
< this is a horrible venue .
< you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
< do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
< but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
< owner : a very rude man .
< this place is a terrible place to live !
< stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
< my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
< it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
< what about the time i wasted ?
< there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
< the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
< executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .
< this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
< not even real brown sauce .
< i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .
< but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
< his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
< i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
< the salads are ok , nothing special .
< overall it was a miserable evening .
< the woman did n't even apologize .
< i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
< zero complaints with his work .
< the garlic bread was bland and cold .
< the espresso was way too hot .
< i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
< they wo n't tell you though .
< i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
< gammage itself however is not so amazing .
< needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
< i wo n't be ordering again .
< let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .
< she did not apologize or anything .
< prices are just plain retail .
< but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
< it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
< who knows , it might have been .
< the beer sauce is lackluster at best .
< the building itself looks abandoned .
< we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
< i 've never had a worse experience than this !
< no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
< if i could give zero stars i def would .
< only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .
< no call , no nothing .
< i wish i could give less than one star .
< the wonton was seriously lacking filling .
< if i could give less stars , i would .
< she could not and would not explain herself .
< think twice -- this place is a dump .
< i 'm not one of the corn people .
< it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
< even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .
< as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years .
< i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .
< so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .
< at this location the service was terrible .
< so who do i call to get my money back .
< overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .
< i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .
< service was a little slow to begin with .
< only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
< the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
< i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
< just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .
< i expected so much better from this ny staple .
< i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .
< the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .
< they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
< the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .
< i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .
< i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .
< and the cleaning is way over priced .
< they make a bad name for used car dealers .
< when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
< just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .
< so sad but i am not going back any more .
< this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
< the new management team is horrible !
< just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
< they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .
< the evening started out slow .
< i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .
< the queen bed was horrible !
< meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
< oh , i should not have asked .
< my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .
< this place is just ok .
< i have to say i was truly disappointed .
< this is the reason i will never go back .
< furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
< when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
< the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
< nope , way way worse .
< there are no smiles and no customer service .
< when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .
< the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .
< if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .
< plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .
< overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
< it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?
< the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
< food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
< was n't busy , no biggie .
< the bathroom area is nothing special .
< this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
< also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .
< so i brought my business elsewhere .
< exhibit c : no more student services peeps .
< so disappointing from an old favorite .
< it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
< tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .
< the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
< i will never visit the salon again .
< they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
< i would n't go back there again .
< this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
< the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
< as for the food , never had it .
< however , the tech said nothing to me about this .
< i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
< my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .
< i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
< it does not take that long to cook sliders !
< the sandwich was not that great .
< the man did not stop her .
< um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .
< tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
< it is also quite expensive for my taste .
< food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
< lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .
< it shows that this restaurant has no class .
< one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
< we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
< my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .
< when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
< we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
< even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .
< wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
< as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .
< the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
< but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
< just terrible is all i can say .
< did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
< his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .
< stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .
< we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .
< i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
< always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
< however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .
< so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
< overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
< one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .
< there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
< is zero stars an option ?
< in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
< but let this story begin at noon today .
< seriously though , i have never shopped here .
< it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
< but their inventory was questionable !
< chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
< so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .
< were we irritating her or something ?
< this place has pissed me off for the last time .
< do not sign a lease with these people .
< do n't waste the trip .
< had to returned one entree because too cold .
< the restroom was a mess .
< i mean that 's been my experience !
< the beef taco was good but nothing special .
< either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
< i went to sit down and wait for my order .
< its also not a very clean park .
< i tried to call repeatedly with no response .
< they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .
< it looks old and outdated .
< he did not return my call either .
< if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
< i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .
< the food here is bland and boring and bad .
< this one is not on the ball .
< for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !
< the tow package is not an issue either .
< very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
< i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .
< i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
< you can not pay me to ever shop here !
< french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .
< now the food : not horrible , but below average .
< this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
< no stars is what in want to give .
< when it came we should have sent it back .
< the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
< i 'm not willing to take the chance .
< this place smelt like old urine for some reason .
< bottom line they over promise and under deliver .
< i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
< nothing that special about this place .
< razz 's failed on every occasion .
< management no longer cares about the golf experience .
< 20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .
< the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
< found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
< not sure and i do n't care !
< two hours of my life i can never get back .
< dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
< very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
< service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .
< second time , not so good .
< the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .
< he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
< what the hell are you doing ?
< the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
< i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
< the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
< finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .
< i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .
< liar , liar , pants on fire .
< parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .
< i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .
< not so great food and service .
< this is an old worn out hotel .
< the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
< the mechanics are very amateur as usual .
< this place is beyond a shit hole .
< this place is a shit hole with shit service .
< however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
< went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .
< service was just as disappointing .
< i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
< the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
< management does not seem to care .
< i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .
< it is not really brown rice .
< did n't even get a response .
< needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving .
< my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .
< i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
< had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .
< she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
< i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .
< i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .
< it did n't get finished .
< we will not be coming back .
< he could n't actually read her pressure , though .
< absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
< ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much .
< even the water tasted horrible .
< and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
< sounds good does n't it ?
< but it was disgusting and hot in there .
< yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
< it was over fried and very hard .
< i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .
< the overall prices are not competitive with frys .
< too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .
< we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .
< and management does n't do anything about it .
< no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .
< what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
< i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !
< these days the quality is pretty lousy .
< this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
< service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
< my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
< and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .
< maybe they were having a bad night ?
< this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !
< the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
< so , it went in the trash .
< it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .
< so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .
< hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .
< the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .
< when it finally came out , it was bad .
< talk about false advertising so call before you go !
< the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
< crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
< but the customer service ruins it all for me .
< i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
< i was very disappointed with this place .
< so you are n't my problem . ''
< unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .
< geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
< she does n't say anything and just walks away .
< the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .
< the staff was nowhere to be found .
< it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .
< it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
< i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .
< save your money & your patience .
< what a waste of my time and theirs .
< one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
< my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .
< the server was n't buying .
< worst customer service i have ever had .
< sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
< and for this reason , i wo n't return .
< this branch is getting worse and worse .
< they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
< they can thank you for the low rating .
< i did n't even eat it .
< this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .
< there was no personality to our server .
< if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .
< i did n't know ra was a chain .
< i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
< went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
< this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
< the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .
< i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
< however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
< is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
< maria the manager is a horrible person .
< it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
< we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .
< first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
< absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
< i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
< oh well , who cares ... right ?
< we will spend our money elsewhere .
< i will never purchase another lv bag again .
< uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .
< we did n't leave with anything that day .
< horrible , horrible , horrible service !
< now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
< this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
< i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
< the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
< you can not judge people based on appearance .
< you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
< the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .
< no courtesy and their food is pathetic .
< i would never reccomend anyone to live here .
< had to wait a month to get in .
< great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
< it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
< next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
< do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .
< prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .
< tonight i lost all respect for this company .
< safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
< i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .
< let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
< it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .
< the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
< included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
< the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
< other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
< the food is not that authentic .
< actually , just keep walking .
< unfortunately , it is the worst .
< the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
< not so much these days .
< did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
< this is the worst panda express location there is !
< the door would n't open at all .
< my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
< the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
< we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
< i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
< it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
< this is a terrible college .
< my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
< sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
< the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .
< i looked around and there were still customers .
< i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
< we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
< in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .
< avoid if at all possible .
< i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .
< we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .
< it 's just too expensive for what you get .
< also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
< went into this location to drop it off .
< we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
< if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .
< too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
< the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .
< the beer was nice and cold !
< the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
< will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
< there are much better places for breakfast .
< the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
< it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .
< um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .
< pathetic place , worst food .
< needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
< firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
< anything they say , ask in writing .
< this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
< but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
< built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
< bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
< if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
< she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .
< incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .
< the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
< the problem is nothing was good .
< i tried to no avail .
< university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
< horrible job on nails and toes .
< i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
< perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .
< simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .
< took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .
< sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
< that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
< the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .
< they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
< desert followed but nothing special .
< no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
< i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
< however , this experience went pretty smooth .
< they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
< since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
< she was getting pissed , and so were we .
< did n't seem to care about their job .
< would have rated lower if i could .
< not personalized or warm at all .
< so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
< i do not like the size of the dance floor .
< this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
< i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
< their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .
< no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .
< three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .
< ra sushi , you are so blah to me .
< half of my head was over processed .
< an old dude did my pedicure .
< like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
< `` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .
< when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
< they do not stock some of the most common parts .
